# INTRODUCTION

The project concept involves an initial product design phase, where the needs of various users are analyzed, and a specific need is targeted. Subsequently, the product is assessed from a business perspective, and a business model is developed.
The creation of physical system models and the application of control schemes for the development of control systems will occur within the VREP Simulation environment. Physical models will initially be crafted using SOLIDWORKS or Inventor software, and later imported into the simulation environment. We will then engage in the actual construction of the robot by manufacturing its various components, exploring different manufacturing techniques, integrating purchased parts, and testing software modules in real-life situations.

# FUNCTIONALITY

A medical assistant robot is designed to aid doctors by semi- autonomously navigating through hospital rooms and efficiently collecting patient information via QR-code. This innovative robot is equipped with sensors and navigation capabilities to accurately maneuver around the hospital environment with line path.
It can access electronic health records and gather relevant patient data through a secure interface using raspberry pi. By doing these tasks, the assistant robot saves time for doctors, allowing them to focus on more critical aspects of patient care and improve overall healthcare efficiency.

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The idea of the robot is inspired by realizing the amount of time doctors & nurses waste to get into rooms to know the current state of the patient. Instead, the doctor can ask our nurse to go to a specific room to scan patient’s QR code and send it to the Doctor via Wi-Fi. Each patient’s room will contain a QR code, containing each patient’s information and health updates that will be detected and scanned by the robot, it will follow its path to reach that room. After, it returns to its original position waiting for the next doctor request.
In order to make it as user-friendly as possible, we created a design that is suitable for its purpose, small, compact, free of sharp edges and exposed wires to be as safe as possible & light in weight, In addition, it has the sensors it needs to detect and avoid obstacles.
